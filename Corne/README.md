# The Corne Keyboard

The corne is a split keyboard laid out in a 3 by 6 column staggered keys, and 3 thumb keys per side.
It functions using the QMK Firmware, which allows full customization of the board, which is very helpful because not everyone willl have the same needs in a keyboard,
specially with one that has only 42 keys and depends on layers in order to access all the characters, key combinations, and macros not available on the base layer.

# Why use a crkbd when I already had a planck?

After using the planck, I realized that I like small keyboards, specially the customization they can have, and I improved my efficiency while coding and writing. 
However, after very long sessions of typing with the planck, I started feeling a bit uncomfortable with my shoulders, because they tend to be inwards because of the 
very compact desing of the planck, so my next choice was to get a split keyboard.

The corne keyboard not only fits the split part, but also removes 3 keys which I really wasn't using in the planck, so my layout didn't change that much, and it allows me to have a more relaxed position for long work sessions. 
I'll still use the planck, because I simply love that board, but from now on, I'll mainly use it on campus or when working outside, however, both boards offer great portability due to their sizes.

# Build
The crkbd isn't a comercially made keyboard, like the planck (which you can get on the Drop website, or Amazon), there isn't a specific vendor or distributor, however, all the information on how to make one is on [Foostans crkbd github](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd).
