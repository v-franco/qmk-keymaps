# QMK Keymaps - By V-Franco

The [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) is used in my keyboards, and this repo contains all of the different Keymaps I make/use.
It will be updated every time I create a new keymap.

Some keymaps are made using [QMK Configurator](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_configurator), and will include the JSON file compatible with the tool, but every keymap (despite being made with the configurator) will have their corresponding .C File adapted to a readable format.
