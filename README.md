# QMK Keymaps - By v-franco

The [QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) is used in my keyboards, and this repo contains all of the different Keymaps I make/use.
It will be updated every time I create a new keymap.

Some keymaps are made using [QMK Configurator](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_configurator), and will include the `JSON` file compatible with the tool, but every keymap (despite being made with the configurator) will have their corresponding `keymap.c` File adapted to a readable format.

##Current keyboards
I currently use two keyboards:

[The Corne Keyboard](https://github.com/v-franco/qmk-keymaps/tree/main/Corne) as my main kb, only used at home atm

[The Planck Keyboard](https://github.com/v-franco/qmk-keymaps/tree/main/Planck)as my second kb, used when working outside.
