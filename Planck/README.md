#The Planck Keyboard

The planck is an ortholinear 40% keyboard laid out in a 4 by 12 grid.
It functions using the QMK Firmware, which allows full customization of the board, which is very helpful because not everyone willl have the same needs in a keyboard,
specially with one that has only 47 keys and depends on layers in order to access all the characters, key combinations, and macros not available on the base layer. 

Since I am a software engineer, I designed my layout with productivity while coding in mind. 
The planck I use is the rev6 by DROP + OLKB, with a complete grid layout (which means all the keys in the board are 1U)

##Base layer
The base layer uses QWERTY as a layout, with a backspace next to my designed spacebar.
Next to the spacebar and the backspace keys, I included the `lower` and `raise` keys, which access layers 2 and 3, respectively.
The shift, ctrl, and alt keys use tap functions in order to act as a normal shift, ctrl, and alt when pressed continously, and to act as (), [], and <> when single-tapped. 
Next to the alt keys, I also included {}. This is because I use these symbols quite often when programming.
The base layer also includes a single Windows key, because I use shortcuts quite often.
The tab key works as a tab when pressed, and when held it activates my layer 4, which is mapped for navigation, copy+paste, and other shortcuts.

##Layer 1
The layer 1 consists of exactly the same layout as the base layer, with the one change being that the layout is Colemak, but all the other keys remain the same as the base layer.

##Layer 2
